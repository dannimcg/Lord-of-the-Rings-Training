The Enemy has done much to strengthen the might of Mordor. It will be some days yet before we can hope to move him.

      " He was no longer cloaked but in a brownish cloak. His helm was thrown back, and on his helm was a small golden star, and on his breast was a small pearl of white glass. His feet were on the ground and there was no sign of feet or hands. He had a broad sword.\n",
      "     Aragorn knelt beside him, bending his hands upon his breast. 'It is not the mark of your race,' he said, 'that you have a sword.'\n",
      "     'It is,' said Legolas. 'Indeed the Men of the East are descended from Dwarves, descended from the heirs of the King of the Mountains. Some of our own kin used to dwell in the lands of Eregion; and they have long been friends with the Men of Rohan, as they are still with the Elves, for they go back and speak the Common Speech of Elves. But even in these days they still speak in their own tongue, which they call Númenor.'\n",
      "      'Númenor!' cried Aragorn. 'We see a sign in the Elf-cloak that some evil thing may have come here; but why now? What is this thing that we have seen, Legolas?'\n",
      "     'The Dead are drawn hither from other lands,' said Legolas. 'Maybe they know something of the perils of this land. But I do not understand their words. They speak of it as the valley of the Dead Marshes.'\n",
      "     'No!' said Aragorn. 'The words must not be taken to mean that they do know. It is not the way of Elves. Elves do not speak of the Dead. The Men of the West speak of the One, and of the Dead. And the Elves of Gondor say that it is the work of Sauron, and it is their hope that we should come to the end of it and find him before he makes his evil schemes too great.

      "     'Then let us take all we can find,' said Gimli.\n",
      "     Merry and Pippin both felt the old man's eyes closing. His eyes glazed, and the cold light of the shutters seemed to touch their faces. Gandalf's face was filled with horror. `It is Saruman, Legolas,' he said, a tremble in his voice.\n",
      "      'Yes, yes,' he said, `so you knew him before I found him. Now he has gone, I have come to give my word that he will not return.'\n",
      "      `Now then,' said Aragorn, 'we must seek him! The evil is nigh! Let us go to the wells of Moria! Here we will hope that hope will not fail.'\n",
      "     There was a rumble of running water behind them. 'If we must cross the waters,' said Gimli, 'we shall wait for Gandalf, and then find that I am not the only Ranger of the Shire.'\n",

      "     'But we cannot stay here all night,' said Pippin. 'We cannot pass the Barrow of Amon Hen in the middle of the night. We must climb up to the Ferry. Will you stay here? For we will not be able to cross the water, as I thought. I am afraid I must be going back down the Ferry in this hurry. And even if we could, I could not cross Moria, even if we could.'\n",
      "     'It would be best to do nothing, whatever we do,' said Gandalf. 'I do not see how we can cross Moria and then come back to Lórien without being seen by Saruman. I do not know what the Elf-lords will think of us, if I go.'\n",

      "'Saruman knows. We found it by a certain path that we have found many times before.'\n",

      "'Maybe, maybe. But Saruman must know, as well as any mortal.'\n",
      "'You cannot use the paths of Orthanc, Legolas. Some of them are deep, or reach to depths far below. You cannot use them.'\n",
      "'You do not know what this darkness is,' said Gandalf. `And I have not found the way, since the long years go by. It will not pass, it will not reach the heights of Moria.'\n",
      "'There is a need for haste,' said Legolas. 'We must seek it as soon as we can. We have done our best, but all that we have left is but a pile of stones.'\n",

In the meanwhile you may rest, if you like; but there are no beds. If the day lasts long, you may sleep under the hills, while I go to some errand or other. And there I shall be safe, and you may go back to sleep. And I hope that I may return, soon. When the day comes I shall see if I can do better than a brief stroll.'\n",
      "     Frodo lay down again and closed his eyes.\n",
      "     'I will think of something,' said Gandalf. `But I shall not tell you any more. My errand is far from home, and I must sleep on my own. I am off on my own now, and I shall be off at nightfall tomorrow.'\n",

      " He was no longer troubled about his errand. He could go on walking quietly and quietly, wherever he liked to go, as long as he kept to the paths, and kept a few things in his pocket. He seemed to be getting along splendidly, and had become rather fond of the Company, even of Frodo. It seemed to him that it was wonderful to hear him talk in his own language, when there was no one else but them. He had come to the end of a long and curious journey, and he was grateful to have done so.\n",
      "     'I suppose you were just saying that you were glad to see me, Gandalf,' said Frodo; 'and glad to see you come back, and I could use the help of strangers, too, and that I might be making a few friends, if I wasn't looking after myself. But there are some funny people in the Shire, if you follow the signs. And you said I looked odd, I said I looked right. But that's a pity, because you look rather queer yourself.'\n",
      "      'Well, you did, though not as odd as I thought,' said Gandalf. 'I've been a bit prisky, and I was talking funny. I suppose you don't like me looking odd, so I suppose it's no great big deal.'\n",
      "     'I don't understand, I suppose, and I don't like being picked on,' said Frodo.\n",
      "     'Well, I don't know why you'd think that. You were trying to explain things, and I don't like being told. But don't worry, Mr. Frodo. I've heard quite enough of you lately, and I'm glad to hear you're pleased with yourself. And I hope you've learned something, and come on your own way. And I hope you've learned something good, too. Come on now! '\n",
      "    'There's a fine line between walking and joking, if you don't look straight ahead,' said Frodo, now genuinely alarmed. 'I don't like being picked on. I'm not saying I'm always going to be taken advantage of. But I have to keep my eyes open. I don't like being pursued. I think I was trying to help Bilbo. I thought you were looking for him. I thought I had slipped out, and somehow\n",

      " `He is a wizard,' he said, 'and a great lord of men.'\n",
      "     `A mighty king!' cried Legolas; and Gimli was amazed to see the old man in such a high place among the Riders: so tall and fair, yet so young and yet so old! He seemed like an older brother than the others that stood before him or followed after his lead into battle-field upon either side – but he had no helm nor sword. His face bore a keen and commanding look as if he were a judge of men's worth. And yet he spoke in a kindly voice with clear voices for the most part, and was not proud or angry. He smiled, though he did show signs also now more clearly then ever when he spoke softly to the others about their own affairs under sunlit sky.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "      `\"He has come to the Last Battle,\" I say again,\" said Aragon stern and gravely \"not to tell you that he will not be here. But he comes to you, Gimli sonof Glóin. For he knows that you are in peril, and he desires peace, even if you do what may seem wise. So do all men who go to war, and you have done what your friends would ask\".'_\n",
      "     `But I am not yet ready\", answered Gandli. _I must go now. The Lord Denethor commands me._ What he means by this we cannot guess, but he says: _The Ring shall remain here, until the end_. I fear that he means _until_ the End. But I know that he does much else. We need it, and we can use its power._ Now he turned away from them and went out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "     '\"So I heard it myself!\" said Legolas. \"_It is a command of Saur-ard that I should give to all my kindred. I wish therefore only one thing: first take back Rohan, where it belongs. That way we might have peace and quiet. But we could still help the Enemy. It seems plain enough to us that the Ring itself is the keystone which he seeks. He knows that it came there, and that we knew it, and made sure arrangements with Saruman. But he would find it hard indeed justifiably hostile to the Ring, if he knew that it was not his own. It certainly would\n",
